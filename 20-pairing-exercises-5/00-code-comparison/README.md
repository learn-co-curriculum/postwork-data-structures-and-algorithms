# Code Comparison

## Introduction

For this activity, you and your partner will each choose a problem that you have
both completed. Either in person or over video chat via screenshare:

- Explain your solutions to each other
- Point out the differences in how you approached solving the problem
- Discuss at least one part of your partner's solution that you liked and have
  learned from
  - Did your partner do something you didn't even think of?
  - Is there something about the way they code that jumps out to you? For
    example, is their code extremely readable without comments?
  - Is their solution more efficient, e.g. better time complexity or uses less
    memory?
- Discuss at least one part of your partner's solution which you think can be
  improved and why
  - Is the solution difficult to understand without heavy commenting?
  - Does it contain redundant/unused code?
  - Should helper methods have been used?
  - Could it easily be made more efficient? For example, were the best data
    structures used to solve the problem?
