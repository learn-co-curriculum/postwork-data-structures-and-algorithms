# A Note on Testing

If we have made a test suite available for a problem, please refrain from
looking at or running those tests until you have:

- Passed the tests given in the README
- Passed the tests you wrote yourself

This will give you a chance to think through the problem and write your own test
cases, which is a skill you’ll need when interviewing.

After you run our tests, you might notice that you missed some test cases: this
is a good thing - it’s a chance for you to learn and grow as a programmer. You
won’t always think of all of the necessary test cases, but as time goes by,
you’ll get better and better at thinking of all of the possible inputs that need
to be solved for before a solution can be considered complete.
