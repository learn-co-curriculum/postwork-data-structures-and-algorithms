# Pair Programming

## Introduction

For this activity, you will pair up and complete a challenge from the previous
exercises pair-programming style! In other words, one of you will be the driver
and the other will be the navigator, and then you will switch. Remember to be
patient with one another and to keep the lines of communication open. If one of
you becomes quiet for an extended period of time, ask a question to help keep
things moving.

## Instructions

- Choose a problem from the previous exercises that you were unable to solve,
  have not tried yet, or struggled with a lot
- If you are the navigator, you will guide the driver by doing the following:
  - Communicate in simple and small steps what code should be written
  - Explain why you're making those decisions
  - Inform the driver when they're misunderstanding your directions or are making syntactical errors
  - Point out any improvements that can be made to the code
  - If time allows and problem has been solved, guide the driver through a refactor to improve the code
- If you are the driver, you will write code according to the navigator's instructions:
  - Ask questions when you don't understand the what or the why
  - If you disagree with a decision, diplomatically state your disagreement and why
  - Be the typist
  - Stay focused on the current task
