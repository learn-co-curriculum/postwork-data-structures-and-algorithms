# Day 3: Fibonacci Series

Find the nth element in the Fibonacci series. The Fibonacci sequence starts with
a 0 followed by a 1. After that, every value is the sum of the two values
preceding it. Here are the first seven values as an example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5,
8.

```
Input: 0
Output: 0

Input: 2
Output: 1

Input: 10
Output: 55
```

Note that we are using zero-indexing for the series.

Use the language of your choosing. We've included starter files for some
languages where you can pseudocode, explain your solution and code.

## Before you start coding:

1. Rewrite the problem in your own words
2. Validate that you understand the problem
3. Write your own test cases
4. Pseudocode
5. Code!

**_And remember, don't run our tests until you've passed your own!_**

## How to run your own tests

### Ruby

1. `cd` into the ruby folder
2. `ruby <filename>.rb`

### JavaScript
